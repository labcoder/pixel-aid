# Algorithms

The current algorithms are intentionally clean first versions. They favor deterministic behavior and testability over final production quality.

## Image Model

Core functions operate on:

```ts
type RGBAImage = {
  width: number;
  height: number;
  data: Uint8ClampedArray;
};
```

Pixel loops use typed arrays and integer offsets.

## Grid Detection

`detectGridCandidates` computes simple vertical and horizontal edge-energy arrays and scores periodic boundary candidates by scale and phase. It returns multiple candidates with confidence and reasons. This is the API shape future runs-based and hybrid scoring should extend.

## Block Downsampling

`downsampleBlocks` converts source blocks into true output pixels. Current strategies:

- `dominant`: clusters similar colors for noise tolerance, then returns the average representative color from the winning cluster instead of the coarse bucket color.
- `median`: uses per-channel median values.
- `adaptive`: uses dominant color when coverage is high, otherwise median.
- `averageThenPalette`: averages the block before later palette remapping.

This is the main fake-pixel-to-real-pixel conversion path. It does not use bilinear, bicubic, or Lanczos resizing.

## Palette

`extractPalette` preserves exact colors when the image is already within the color budget. When it exceeds the budget, it falls back to frequency-ranked 5-bit RGB buckets. `remapToPalette` maps visible pixels to the nearest palette color by RGB distance. This gives stable, deterministic first-milestone behavior and can be replaced by a stronger quantizer behind the same API.

## Alpha Cleanup

Implemented modes:

- `preserve`: clone alpha unchanged.
- `binary`: threshold alpha to 0 or 255.
- `backgroundFloodFill`: flood-fill connected edge/corner background color to transparency.

## Sheet Slicing

`sliceSheetFrames` generates deterministic row-major frame rectangles from frame size, rows, columns, margin, spacing, and extrusion metadata.
